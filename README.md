## Design and analysis of all-electric aircraft 
##### Application Report
The need for small sized Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) has significantly increased in the past decade due
to its compactness and ability to carry out search operations in remote locations. With this motivation, we
are coming up with a UAV design which is to be presented at the SAEISS Aero Design Challenge 2020. This
report gives detailed information about the objective of our UAV and the variety of electronics used. Our
UAV will be equipped with a self-designed Data Acquisition System to transmit live information of the
surveillance area. The system consists of an HD Camera capable of working in both daylight and night,
Thermal Imaging Sensors, GPS, Accelerometer and Gyroscope. The recorded data will be transmitted to a
ground station for analysis and will be further sent to the rescue teams. Medical kits as payloads will be
dropped by the UAV upon identification of people in the needed locations.

##### Fabrication Report
GPS (Global positioning System) is a positioning system based on a network of satellites that continuously transmit coded
information. The information transmitted from the satellites can be interpreted by receivers to precisely identify locations
on earth by measuring distances from the satellites.
Basically, it’s a navigation system using satellites, a receiver and algorithms to synchronize location, velocity and time data
for air, sea and land travel.
The GPS system consists of an antenna and RF circuit at the front-end that receives signals from satellites. Thereafter the
signal is being processed by the receiver circuit using signal converter, oscillators, microcontrollers and other circuit
elements. Data modulation and storage are done using a data storage device and subsequently the receiver circuit
outputs the data in the coded strings format which is further analyzed by interface software and gives us the results
including location along with time.
The satellite system consists of a constellation of 24 satellites in six Earth-centered orbital planes, each with four satellites,
orbiting at 13,000 miles (20,000 km) above Earth and traveling at a speed of 8,700 mph (14,000 km/h).
While we only need three satellites to produce a location on earth’s surface, a fourth satellite is often used to validate the
information from the other three. The fourth satellite also moves us into the third-dimension and allows us to calculate the
altitude of a device.
The GPS system gives output in NMEA string format which consists of the following information: longitude, latitude,
altitude, time.

##### Final Design Report
The objective is to design an aircraft that can lift as much weight as possible while observing the
available power and aircraft’s length, width, and height requirements along with low empty weight
and high payload fraction.
